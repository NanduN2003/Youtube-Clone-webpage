# Youtube-Clone-website

■ Technologies used:- HTML,CSS

▷ This was the intial stepping work of my mine while heading towards WEB DEVOPLOMENT concept.So,the whole point of creating an this Non-Responsive Youtube clone was to gain courage for exploration in the 'DEV' department where started to make out an webpage by using only HTML and CSS.

▷ I had concisely made efforts to put down the exact replica of Youtube and added all the structure and styles which makes my clone page seems precisely as that of Youtube's one.
